What is "personal information?"

"Personal information" means information which either directly identifies you (like your name, email address, or billing information) or can be reasonably linked or combined to identify you (like an account identification number or IP address). Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."

If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.

How is "personal information" obtained?

As TubeShift operates it must transmit information over the Internet to servers. This results in the IP address associated with your computer being stored in system logs. The TubeShift browser extension itself does not transmit any "personal information" to the TubeShift servers during operation. It is still possible for "personal information" to be collected and transmitted in circumstances such as:

    * You provide it directly (e.g., when you choose to send in a crash report). This information could include all browser activity and visited URLS because of detailed logging used for debugging. You will have to provide explicit consent before "personal information" is transmitted in this way.

    * You communicate with TubeShift support such as by sending in an email. Your email address or other contact information will be collected as a part of routine operation of the communication servers.

How is your "personal information" used?

When personal information is provided or collected it will be used in the ways for which you've already been informed or given us permission. Generally this information is used to enable the operation of TubeShift, understand and improve the user experience, and to understand and fix errors during operation.

When is "personal information" shared with third parties?

    * When we have asked and received your permission to share it.

    * For processing or providing products and services to you but only if this is required to support the processing and providing of products and services.

    * When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. When when such a request is received we'll only release your personal information if there is a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so.

What is not done with your "personal information?"

    * Your personal information will never be sold.

    * Your personal information will never be given to a third party unless it is according to the policies described in 'When is "personal information" shared with third parties?'

    * Your personal information will never be used to market to you.

How is your "personal information" stored and protected?

We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures. Despite our best efforts it is possible that unauthorized release of your "personal information" could happen such as through a security breach. If we learn of a security breach an announcement will be made via the TubeShift browser extension.

"Personal information" contained in server logs is only stored for as long as the log entries are useful for the operation and troubleshooting of the information system that supports TubeShift. Generally system logs are purged after several weeks but some logs may be stored for longer periods of time as needed.

What if this privacy policy changes?

In the future this privacy policy may need to change. If that happens the privacy policy will be updated with the extension management website for your browser. Your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
