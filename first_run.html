        <h1>Thanks For Installing TubeShift!</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the browser extension that helps you watch less YouTube. There are a few things
            that need to be setup and that you should know about before you get started.
        </p>

        <p>
            TubeShift works better if you enable access to the video platform web pages. This is
            the same thing an ad blocker needs but gives you more control over which websites it
            will happen on. <button id="enable-host-permissions">Click To Enable</button>
