            <p>Welcome to the browser extension that helps you watch less YouTube.</p>

                TubeShift works better if you enable access to the video platform web pages. This is
                the same thing an ad blocker needs but gives you more control over which websites it
                will happen on.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Look in the upper right hand side of your browser for the TubeShift arrow.
                <img class="popup-help-image" src="/img/browser-popup-1.png">
            </p>

            <p>
                If you don't see the TubeShift arrow then click on the jigsaw puzzle piece icon and then pin
                TubeShift.

                <img class="popup-help-image" src="/img/browser-pin-2.png">
            </p>

            <p>
                Click on the TubeShift arrow to see the user interface. This is where you can see the list of
                known alternative locations for the video you are watching as well as where you access the
                extension settings.
